# React Easy Linify

React Easy Linify is a Component of React for finding URL/metions/hashtags and converting them to Links.

This package is based of [Linkifyjs](https://github.com/Soapbox/linkifyjs). I rewrote its `scanner`, React Component and Plugin Module, make them more flexible.

**Very importantly**, I made it be supported i18n. You can customize extended characters.
